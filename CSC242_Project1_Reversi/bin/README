 The code for Project 1 Reversi is in the file "Porject 1", which consists 3 .java files (Cell.java, CreatePlayBoard.java, Reversi.java)
 The "Reversi.java" contains the main method, just run this file if you want to play the game;
 the "CreatePlayBoard.java" contains all the methods we used;
 the "Cell.java" is a class we built to store positions on the chess board.
 

 How we build the project:
 1. read the pseudocode in textbook;
 2. initialize the game "CreatPlayBoard.java" 1-30
 4. write the "basic" functions "CreatPlayBoard.java" 30-688 & TEST & DEBUG.................
 5. change the pseudocode into java code & TEST & DEBUG...........................
 6. think the logic in building main method
 7. write the main method & TEST & DEBUG....................
 
 For the Heuristic function, We think the four corners would have the most impact on the result of the game, because if a player has a chess piece on one corner, he has the opportunity to flip most of his opponent's chess pieces vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. Therefore, we set the score of four coners as 3 points. And same reason for the four outer sides, but they are less significant than the four corners, so we set the score of four outer sides as 2 points. Finally, we think the inner cells are not very essential while playing the game, so we set the score of inner cells as 1. 
 
 This program can play the Reversi game with human without reporting any error (in the console or in the terminal). So it perfectly meets all the requirements.
